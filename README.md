# uSDX-Radio-Fonts

A collection of 8x8 Bitmap fonts compatible with the uSDX radio project


## Summary

In my uSDX radio projects I modified the source code to move the
font data to an external C include file. You can either make a similar
mod or just cut and past the font data into your uSDX source code.
Note that I also changed the logo character in the font data so you will
need to revert that section of the font file to match your source code.


## Group #1: fonts based on the uSDX source code

* font #1  uSDX default font
